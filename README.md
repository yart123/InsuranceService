# Insurance Service Smart Contract

I made this example project to practice writing solidity contracts, as a part of Metacrafters Advanced Solidity course.
This project allows creation of insurance quotes and management of insurance policies by the contract owner, and policy creation and payment of premiums.

# How to run

After cloning the repo, you will want to do the following to get the code running on your computer.

- Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: `npm i`
- Run `npx hardhat compile` and `npx hardhat test` to compile solidity code and verify it works
